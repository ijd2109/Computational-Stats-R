# Practice the methods
# Exercise: Consider the function sin(x) between -3pi/4 and 3pi/4
# a) Plot sin(x) and its first and second derivatives 
# Set accuracy parameter to 10e-5

# b) Find min of sin(x). Use staring interval (-2, -1).
# c) Find max of sin(x). This time use starting interval (0.5, 2.5).
# d) Find the root of sin(x) in the given interval
# e) Compare the methods in terms of number of iterations
